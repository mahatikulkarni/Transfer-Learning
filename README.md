# Transfer-Learning
<br/>Transfer learning, used in machine learning, is the reuse of a pre-trained model on a new problem. In transfer learning, a machine exploits the knowledge gained from a previous task to improve generalization about another. For example, in training a classifier to predict whether an image contains food, you could use the knowledge it gained during training to recognize drinks.
